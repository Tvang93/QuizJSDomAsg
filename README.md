Peer Review: Andrie Amor

Code works as intended and works very well. I like how you made the max length for the box number text area to only 1. Your code only allows the following colors which is also good. I can't really say I have any criticism, it meets the requirements and more. Maybe an alert but that is up to you. Nice work.
